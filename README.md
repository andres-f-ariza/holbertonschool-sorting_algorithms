#Sorting Algorithm Project
=======
*Sorting Algorithm Project*

This project provides implementations of three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. These algorithms are used to sort arrays of integers in ascending order.

##Algorithms

The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

###Bubble Sort:

This algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the entire array is sorted.

###Insertion Sort:

This algorithm builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the previous elements and inserting it in the correct position.

###Selection Sort:

This algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted part. It repeats this process until the entire array is sorted.

##Usage

To use the sorting algorithms provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd sorting-algorithms

3.Include the appropriate header file (sort.h) in your code to access the sorting functions.

4. Call the desired sorting function passing the array and its size as parameters.

5. Optionally, use the provided print_array or print_list functions to display the intermediate or final state of the array or linked list.

##Acknowledgments

The implementations of the sorting algorithms in this project are based on well-known algorithms found in computer science literature.
